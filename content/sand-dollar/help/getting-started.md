The Sand Dollar Project aims to digitize the Bahamian dollar into a blockchain-based currency, also known as Sand Dollars. Anyone can have a Sand Dollar account and enjoy the facilities offered by it. These include the Sand Dollar Card and the Sand Dollar Wallet App.

You should have received your Sand Dollar Card, downloaded the Sand Dollar Wallet App, and paired them together when you first used the Sand Dollar Wallet App. With your card and wallet app linked, you can now use them to transact Sand Dollars.

## Sand Dollars

The Sand Dollar is the digital equivalent to the Bahamian Dollar and is worth as much as a Bahamian Dollar. You can transact in Sand Dollars using the Sand Dollar Card or Wallet App.
