These challenges are especially compounded for archipelagic states and nations with geographically dispersed regions with low population densities. In order to extend financial inclusion to all the remote communities in an economically feasible way, a new type of approach is required.</p> <p data-scroll="once">NZIA has developed an innovative Decentralized Wireless Payment System, consisting of a modular design that can be customized to meet regional needs ranging from highly dense urban cities to sparse rural towns and villages. In order to streamline upfront investment costs, our systems can be adapted to work with existing infrastructure and easily scale on an as-needed basis, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
