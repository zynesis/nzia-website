            <p data-scroll>To provide broad accessibility and ensure constant availability of CBDC across a nation, there are significant technical challenges that must be overcome. These challenges are especially compounded for archipelagic states and nations with geographically dispersed regions with low population densities. In order to extend financial inclusion to all the remote communities in an economically feasible way, a new type of approach is required.</p> <p data-scroll>NZIA has developed an innovative Decentralized Wireless Payment System, consisting of a modular design that can be customized to meet regional needs ranging from highly dense urban cities to sparse rural towns and villages. In order to streamline upfront investment costs, our systems can be adapted to work with existing infrastructure and easily scale on an as-needed basis, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

                Alice decides that she&#39;ll need to spend half of her pay taking care of expenses. Using her mobile smart phone, she opens her carrier&#39;s mobile app that has already been integrated into NZIA though APIs, to allow her topup with just a few clicks using CBDC.

Typically in these scenarios, signs would go up at merchants letting people know system is down so cash only.
